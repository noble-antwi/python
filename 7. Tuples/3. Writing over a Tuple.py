'''Although you canâ€™t modify a tuple, you can assign a new value to a variable
that holds a tuple. So if we wanted to change our dimensions, we could
redefine the entire tuple:'''
dimensions = (200, 50)
print("Original dimensions:")
for dimension in dimensions:
    print(dimension)


dimensions = (400, 100) 
print("\nModified dimensions:")
for dimension in dimensions:
    print(dimension)
