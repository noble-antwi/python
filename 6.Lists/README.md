# LISTS IN PYTHON

Lists allow you to store
sets of information in one place, whether you
have just a few items or millions of items. Lists are
one of Python’s most powerful features readily accessible
to new programmers, and they tie together many
important concepts in programming.

## What Is a List?

A list is a collection of items in a particular order. You can make a list that
includes the letters of the alphabet, the digits from 0–9, or the names of
all the people in your family. You can put anything you want into a list, and the items in your list don’t have to be related in any particular way. Because
a list usually contains more than one element, it’s a good idea to make the
name of your list plural, such as letters, digits, or names.

In Python, square brackets ([]) indicate a list, and individual elements
in the list are separated by commas. Here’s a simple example of a list that
contains a few kinds of bicycles:
``` py
bicycles = ['trek', 'cannondale', 'redline', 'specialized']
```
