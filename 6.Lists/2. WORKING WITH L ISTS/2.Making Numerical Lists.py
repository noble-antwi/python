# Lists are ideal for storing sets of numbers, and Python provides a number of tools to help you work efficiently with lists of numbers.
for number in range(1,10): #
    print(number)

'''

The range() function causes Python to start counting at the first
value you give it, and it stops when it reaches the second value you provide.
Because it stops at that second value, the output never contains the end
value, which would have been 5 in this case.
