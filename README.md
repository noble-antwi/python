# Python Learning Journey üêç

This repository is a personal log of my journey learning Python.  
It contains code snippets, notes, and small projects as I explore the language and build my skills.

## Why this repo?

To stay consistent, track my progress, and create a reference I can always come back to.  
From basics to real-world applications, this is where it all lives.

## Topics I'm covering

- Python fundamentals (syntax, loops, functions, etc.)
- Working with files and data
- Object-Oriented Programming
- Web scraping and automation
- And more as I grow...

## How to use

Clone the repo and run any `.py` file you're curious about.  
No fancy setup‚Äîjust Python and curiosity!

```bash
git clone https://github.com/noble-antwi/python.git
cd python
